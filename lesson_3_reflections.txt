When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to share your work with others or when you would like multiple people to work on the projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You might be working on something and don't want your local copy of files updated which would cause you to lose the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	You would use clone to create a copy of a repository either locally or from a server URL. You would use fork to copy a repository on a server URL to your own server location.  The fork is the same as a clone command except that it only copies repositories on the server. A branch command is used to to create a different path of commits, possibly for a different feature or version that differs from the general direction of the existing master branch.  A branch is only used locally within a repository.


Commands:

git remote			Show all current remotes
git remote add <name> <URL>	Add remote with name linking it to the URL
git remote -v			Show remote in verbose mode with more details. 
git push <remote> <branch>	Push changes from the local to the server specified by remote of the local branch.
git pull <remote> <branch>	Pull changes from the server specified by remote and specified server branch to the local repository.
