What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a metadata file that is used by the git repository.  The file is called '.git'.  It is necessary for git to work properly.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It's a temporary holding area of which files will be tracked when a commit command is given.  It allows you to selectively choose files without using the whole directory or to track logical changes.
